#### Introduction

Several thousands developers each year fill out a 30-min survey on the Stack Overflow website. This survey collects data about Stack Overflow users using various attributes. In this project, survey data from multiple years has been used to perform analysis and gain insights as well as recommendations with regard to multiple attributes, some of them being demographics, programming languages, coding experience, job satisfaction among developers. 

Post the analysis we have derived certain answers and generated recommendations using algorithms like Support Vector Machine(SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor, Linear Regression and Random Forest.
